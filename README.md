👋 Hello, I'm Evangelos Mitikas!

I'm an undergraduate Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at the University of West Attica (UniWA), specializing in Communications and Networks. I'm passionate about leveraging programming, cloud computing, and machine learning to create solutions that automate and simplify everyday tasks.
🔭 What I’m Working On:

  - Research at CONSERT Lab: Building a web application for real-time data monitoring and visualization using Grafana, Docker, and FastAPI as part of the Metro16 project.
  - Volunteering with IEEE: Leading and coordinating events, workshops, and coding competitions at IEEE SB UniWA, including Rest API and cloud computing projects.

🌱 My Technical Interests:

  - Cloud Computing
  - Machine Learning
  - IoT Projects
  - Web Development
  - Telecommunications & Networking

⚙️ Tools & Technologies I Use:
    
  - Languages: Python, JavaScript, Matlab
  - Frameworks: FastAPI, Docker, Grafana
  - Others: Git, NodeRED, Arduino, MQTT

🚀 Personal Projects:

  - CapCounterIoT: An IoT system using Arduino and NodeMCU to track bottle caps with real-time data via MQTT.
  - SchedulerEEE: A tool that generates semester schedules for students, built with Python and later redeveloped as a full-stack web app.
  - Pattern Recognition of Warplanes: A Matlab-based project identifying warplanes using computer vision and machine learning.
